## Abstract

Data is often used to initiate change. 

Indeed, the statistical analysis of data can help to test ideas and hypothesis and provide support for change. 

Yet, it is the interaction with people which matters the most.

Communicating the results of a data analysis and helping others to see the stories in the numbers is challenging. 

I will talk about my experience and the tools I developed to build engaging relationships with my colleagues.

## This talk will change your life

*** pnotes

This talk is very much about change.
I suppose any talk would like to initiate change.
We, as presenters, think that we have something to tell, 
which will change your life. Forever.
So, basically you will sit through a whole day of marketing.

Yet, change is challenging.
We are human beings, and we only change if we have to.
You want to loose some weight? Eat less and exercise more. Easy.
It's hard isn't it.

## Trust me

*** pnotes

Well, but if my doctor, who I trust, would tell me that 
I need to change or otherwise I would develop a life threatening
disease, then I actually might listen.
I listen to my doctor, because I know him for many years
and he has helped me in the past.
Why would you listen to me and take any advice?
I am up here, so maybe that gives me some authoritative.
